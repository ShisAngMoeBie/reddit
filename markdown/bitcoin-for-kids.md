Assuming you have a willing parent or guardian, here's an example of how that would work for a minor in the US via CashApp.  Ensure your upfront with the parent or guardian as to what your doing.

(If your parent or guardian is unwilling, skip ahead)

1. Get a summer job with some source of direct deposit income.
2. Ask your legal guardian to help you open a "Youth Spending" checking account also called UTMA.
3. Ask for a debit card attached to the account.
4. Have your summer job paychecks direct deposited to the account.
5. Download the CashApp and link it to your phone number ***AND*** email.
6. Link the CashApp to your Youth Spending Debit card and checking account.
7. Attempt to transfer $25 from your debit card into your CashApp, assuming you have the money.
8. Ask your guardian to fill in their SSN when prompted.
9. Attempt to buy $20 in stock, ask your guardian to answer the questions.
10. Go to the Bitcoin section and click to enable bitcoin deposit and withdraw.
11. Ask your guardian to scan their license and take a selfie.

You can also apply for a CashCard which you can add to Google Pay, Android Pay, Garmin Pay, or whatever.  Once all the verification are done (a day or two) you will be able to buy and sell US stocks and bitcoin in the app for a 2% fee.  For all of these steps, questions about identity, name and address should all be answered as the guardian, not the minor.  So the account name is in the name "Adult Smith" not "Minor Smith".  Same with SSN and ID checks.  You can choose to put your name on the face of the CashCard and Debit Card since this carries no legal weight.  The accounts are all still legally in your parent's or guardian's name.

For even lower fees you could ask your parents or guardians to KYC through Binance, Kraken, Gemini or Coinbase to link your checking account to a real exchange.

For those with guardians or parents that would not agree to KYC for you, here are some non-KYC options, though the fees are much (much) higher than 2%.

* [P2P exchanges (e.g., LocalBitcoins, Bisq, HodlHodl, Paxful, etc.,)](https://new.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8/list_of_bitcoin_persontoperson_p2p_bitcoin/)
* [Purse.io/earn](https://purse.io/earn/btc) (shop Amazon for BTC, must be 13yo).
* [Mycelium Local Trader](https://mycelium.com/lt/help.html)
* [Meetup.com - Bitcoin](https://www.meetup.com/topics/bitcoin/) or any meetup you can find.  Ask (discretely) to buy BTC for cash after the meeting.
* Switch to [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/bri541) ^(referral) and get small amounts of cryptocurrency while you surf, but you can't cash out till your 18.
* Buy altcoin then [convert to Bitcoin](https://new.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cd1fr8/list_of_nokyc_instant_exchanges/).  Different coins have different P2P buy options.
* Mining <= Super crazy risky unless your a savaont, makeing a profit is hard.
* Craigslist sell for Bitcoin (double the price and offer 50% off if paid with Bitcoin)
* Work for crypto (mow lawns and offer 50% off if they pay with Bitcoin).
* Look at a [Bitcoin Job Board](https://new.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e8exv1/willing_to_work_for_bitcoin_00004_btchour/fabcw8w/) to see if you could do any work there.
* Look at [Lopp's ATM List](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/buying-earning.html).  There may be some non-KYC ATMs near you, but they are rare.

Please remember that bitcon is easy to steal.  Since minor's have limited standing in US courts, most exchanges don't want to deal with them.  If you proceed there is a 100% chance that someone ***will*** try to scam you.  Make sure you catch every scammer you encounter, or you will go broke fast.
