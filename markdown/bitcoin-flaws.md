Well I can think of a few:

1. Asteroid hits the planet and kills all human life
2. Solar mass ejection washes earth in EMF frying all electronics
3. Magnetic poles reverse washing the earth in EMF frying all electronics

Here are some things that would make it crash to near zero for a while.

1. Fatal flaw (I mean fatal) is discovered in `secp256k1` making it trivially factorable
2. Mathematicians solve the 3000 year mystery of how to trivially factor polynomial curve arithmetic (EC)
3. Mathematicians disprove the Riemann's hypothesis 
3. Someone develops (in stealth) new ASIC orders of magnitude more efficient than existing miners and builds enough to take the lions share of mining.

Most of these events (except [4]) would be so cataclysmic that the effect on bitcoin would be the least of your worries.
