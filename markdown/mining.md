> Can anyone explain how to mine btc (equipment etc)

1. Move to a country with free electricity
1. Buy an ASIC miner
2. Rework the HVAC in your house to direct all the AC to your mining room
3. Rework the wiring in your house so that your miner is on a 20 Amp circuit
4. Rework the walls of your mining room with attic insulation so it's noise is below 120 dB
5. Run CAT5 cables from your router to your mining room
6. Decide on a mining pool
7. Hook up your miner
8. Hope you can mine enough BTC to pay off [2] before the miner reaches obsolescence

For the ASIC miner part, they generally run between $1000 - $5000 a piece.  They are about the volume of a leaf blower for reference and about the temperature of a stove-top on low heat.  From there on out google (or DDG) is your friend.

> I want to start mining

Start by [mining testnet](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-solo-mine-on-bitcoin-s-testnet-6073c917b495) with a toy [USB miner](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_ex_kw=&_mPrRngCbx=1&_nkw=block+erupter&_sacat=&_sop=12&_udhi=&_udlo=&_fosrp=1) to figure out how it all works.

Most of the time the difficulty will be too high, but sometimes testnet difficulty goes to `1` at which point you may have a shot a getting a testnet block with your toy.

Once you get the setup figured out, you can start the real investment in a serious ASIC miner.
