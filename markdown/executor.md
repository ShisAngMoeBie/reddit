Here's what I did, but most would find it easier to just use the [Casa product](https://keys.casa/bitcoin-inheritance-plan/)

***

My spouse and kids know where a sealed note is.  Inside the note is instructions on how to query my crypto balance via `xpub` and where to find my seed.  The instructions are simple, but in such a way that only my benefactors could realistically execute them.

My will names a specific member of my family as the cryptography executor to my estate.  This executor will be in charge of decryption of my personal files for my family as well as disposing of the cryptocurrency according to their wishes.

The executor does not know my seed and will only be given the seed once my benefactors have verified the balance in the wallet.  If BTC moons and the amount becomes more than the executor can be trusted with, my benefactors will need to think of a way to add legal teeth to the probation of my estate.

Basically my `legal-will.txt` and a `where-is-the-seed.txt` files are both clear-signed with my PGP key and are replicated in separate geographic locations.
