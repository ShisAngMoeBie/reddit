> Best Wallets to use on Mac?

The "best" wallet is a HW wallet.  They are much more difficult for an attacker to compromise, but they cost money.

* KeepKey $50 - Promo for $10 (80% off) if you KYC with their exchange
* Trezor-1 $55 - Provides Deterministic builds (max open-source)
* Ledger-S $60 - Provides "Secure Element" (SE), ***mostly*** open source
* Ledger-X $120 - Provides "Secure Element" (SE), ***mostly*** open source
* ColdCard $120 - Provides SE, and source, but cannot verify builds 
* Trezor-T $160 - Provides Deterministic builds (max open-source)

All of these work with Electrum, but you'll have to RTFM to determine which work with your particular collection of altcoins.
