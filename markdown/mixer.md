Well "good" is relative.

* Wasabi - Requires minimum of 0.1 BTC to mix, fees are what you allow them to be
* Whirpool - Requires minimum of 0.01 BTC to mix, 5% fee
* JoinMarket - Has no minimum, but realistically 0.01 is the likely smallest you should try
* ChipMixer (custodial \*hiss\*) allows 0.001 size UTXOs.  Fee is your risk of being robbed.

JoinMarket or Wasabi are probably the "best".  Whirlpool is a lot easier.  ChipMixer is the easiest but its custodial (\*hiss\*).

Also, you can offer liquidity on JoinMarket making your mixes free, or even (ever so slightly) profitable.
